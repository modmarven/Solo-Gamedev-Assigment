Description

In this project, you will create a game where a button appears at random positions on the screen, and the player must click it to score points. 
This exercise will help you understand UI elements, random positioning, click detection, and basic game timing. By the end of this project, 
you'll have an interactive button-clicking game with scoring and time constraints.
