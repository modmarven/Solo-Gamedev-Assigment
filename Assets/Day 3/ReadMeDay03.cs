Description 

In this project, you will create a basic version of the classic arcade game Pong. This exercise will help you understand ball physics, paddle movement, and simple AI behavior. 
By the end of this project, you'll have a functional Pong game with single-player mode, complete with scoring and ball movement mechanics.

Mechanics

    Ball physics
    Paddle movement

Systems Involved

    Rigidbodies, colliders
    Basic physics
    AI paddle for single-player mode

Steps

    Create a new Unity project and add a 2D scene.
    Create paddles and a ball using 2D sprites.
    Add Rigidbodies and Colliders to the paddles and ball.
    Write a script to control the player paddle using keyboard input.
    Implement basic AI for the opponent paddle.
    Add a script to handle ball movement and bouncing off paddles and walls.
    Add scoring zones and a score counter.

Existing Game Examples

    Pong (classic arcade gameplay)
    Breakout (paddle and ball mechanics)
