Collect the coin

Description

In this project, you will create a game where the player must collect as many coins as possible within a limited time. This exercise focuses on coin collection, player movement, collision detection, score tracking, and implementing a timer.
By the end of this project, you'll have a fun and engaging coin-collection game that challenges the player's speed and efficiency.

Mechanics

    Coin collection
    Timer


Systems Involved

    Coin spawn system
    Player controller
    Collision detection
    Score counter
    Timer

Steps

    Create a new Unity project and set up a simple environment.
    Add a player character and floor.
    Create coin objects and write a script to spawn them randomly.
    Write a script to control the player character to collect coins.
    Implement collision detection to detect when the player collects a coin.
    Add a score counter to track the number of coins collected.
    Add a timer to limit the game duration.

Existing Game Examples

    Super Mario (coin collection)
    Sonic the Hedgehog (ring collection)

Basic Platform

Description

In this project, you will create a basic platformer game where the player navigates through platforms by jumping and moving. This exercise focuses on platform navigation, jumping mechanics, gravity, and level design. 
By the end of this project, you'll have a foundational platformer game that can be expanded with more complex levels and mechanics.

Mechanics

    Jumping
    Platform navigation

Systems Involved

    Player controller with jumping
    Platforms
    Gravity
    Level design

Steps

    Create a new Unity project and set up a 2D scene.
    Create a player character and platform objects.
    Write a script to control the player character's movement and jumping.
    Implement gravity and collision detection for platforms.
    Design a simple level with platforms to navigate.

Existing Game Examples

    Super Mario Bros.(platform navigation)
    Celeste (jumping mechanics)
